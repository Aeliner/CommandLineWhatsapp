C/C++ Whatsapp Imitation on Command-Line

I made this Whatsapp imitation as part of a project for school when I was learning c / c++.

This imitation lets you create new user via phone number, add other users as friends, send messages
create groups, send group messages, add status, delete friends, even see "seen" status on messages you sent!
